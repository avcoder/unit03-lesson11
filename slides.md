# JWT (pg.1)

1. `npm i jsonwebtoken`
1. in `.env` create a new entry `JWT_SECRET=whatever` 
1. create a new file `/src/modules/auth.js`:
  ```js
  import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

  export const createJWT = ({id, username}) => {
    const token = jwt.sign({ id, username }, process.env.JWT_SECRET); 
    return token; // token is a string
  }
  ```
1. Let's test this so far and see what we get

# JWT (pg.2)
Need to create a bodyguard function that will protect our routes based on whether the request has the token

1. In same auth.js file
  ```js
  export const protect = (req, res) => {
    const bearer = req.headers.authorization;

    if (!bearer) {
      res.status(401);
      res.json({ message: 'not authorized' });
      return;
    }
  }
  ```
1. For now, import our protect function in `server.js` then change our existing `app.use('/api'...)`
  ```js
  import { protect } from './modules/auth.js'

  // Now, a request won't even make it to router if it can't get past protect
  app.use('/api', protect, router)
  ```
1. Let's test what we have so far. Did you get back the `401` "not authorized" message?

# JWT (pg.3)

1. Q: why did it reject again?
   - A: request was missing a Bearer token (which usually is contained in the Header)
1. So let's play hacker and put in a fake bearer token in the request
   - In Postman, underneath the url, click "Auth" tab > in dropdown choose "Bearer Token" > enter any string then test again
   - Did we pass the protect guard function?
1. Let's inspect the Bearer token in Headers on server?
  - Ask ChatGPT: `in express.js, how can i view the request's headers.  in particular, the bearer token.  I just want to console.log it`

# JWT (pg.4) 

1. We need to now check if the token is real and not fake.
1. Continuing after `if (!bearer) { }` block of code
  ```js
  const [, token] = bearer.split(" ");

  if (!token) {
    res.status(401);
    res.json({ message: 'not a valid token' });
    return;
  }
  ```
